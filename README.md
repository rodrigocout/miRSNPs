# miRSNPs
Data integration of SNPs and microRNAs
# This is a data integration approach using a Naive Bayes Classifier
This approach was used in this paper: Integrative Analysis Identifies Genetic Variants Associated With Autoimmune Diseases Affecting Putative MicroRNA Binding Sites. Front Genet. 2018; 9: 139
And in this project presented as a poster at European Society of Human Genetics Conference 2017
P12.001A - Integrative approach and eQTL analysis identify breast cancer risk genetic variants affecting microRNA binding sites.
